  - Give an overview of GitKraken and GitHub.
    - Create a new repository on GitHub and clone it in GitKraken.
    - Create a commit and push to GitHub
    - Make edits to code and view the diffs.

  - Start with discussion of Pandas. Start going over the Pandas chapter from ["Python Data Science Handbook"](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook)
    - `03.00-Introduction-to-Pandas.ipynb`
    - `03.01-Introducing-Pandas-Objects.ipynb`
    - `03.02-Data-Indexing-and-Selection.ipynb`
  - Now, let's briefly move away from notebooks and write `.py` files directly. We'll discuss the pros and cons of working with Notebooks vs `.py` files.
    - To do this, complete the following in-class Pandas exercises within a `.py` file.
    - Break for an set of in-class exercises: [./occupations.ipynb](./occupations.ipynb)
