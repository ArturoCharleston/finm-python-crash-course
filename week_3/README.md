FINM August Python Introduction and Review: Week 3
==================================================

Agenda

  - Today we will use notebooks within VS Code. We'll also begin the discussion of writing `.py` files directly. The week after that we will move away from notebooks entirely. 
  - Discuss the features of using the Python and Jupyter extensions within VS Code.
    - Overview: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/overview
    - Variable explorer and data viewer: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks#_variable-explorer-and-data-viewer
    - Custom notebook diffing: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks#_custom-notebook-diffing
  - Demonstration of Git and GitHub
    - VS Code especially makes Git diffs of Jupyter notebooks easy. Demonstrate why they are otherwise difficult.
  - Very quick review of Numpy, Matplotlib, and Scipy
    - Introduction to [NumPy](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/numpy.html)
    - Introduction to [Matplotlib](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/matplotlib.html)
    - Compare Matplotlib to other plotting libraries: [./comparing_plotting_libraries.ipynb](./comparing_plotting_libraries.ipynb)
    - Introduction to [SciPy](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/scipy.html)
  - Discussion of writing our own modules
    - Start with a review of functions in Python: review the ["Functions"](https://datascience.quantecon.org/python_fundamentals/functions.html) chapter found here: [./functions.ipynb](./functions.ipynb)
