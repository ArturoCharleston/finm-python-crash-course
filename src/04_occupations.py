# # Occupations Introduction
# 
# For this part of the HW, we will practice Pandas using a practice dataset regarding the occupations, location, age, and gender of users of an app.
# 
# ### Two points for each section

# %%
# Run the cell below to add section numbering

# %% [markdown]
# ## Import the necessary libraries

# %% [markdown]
# ## Import the dataset
# 
# Import the dataset from here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justmarkham/DAT8/master/data/u.user
# 
# Assign it to a variable called `users` and use the `user_id` as index. (Hint: Use `pd.read_csv(url, sep='|')`)

# %%


# %% [markdown]
# ## Print the first 25 entries
# 
# Use `head` to do this.

# %%


# %% [markdown]
# ## View the last 10 entries
# 
# Use `tail`

# ## What is the number of observations in the dataset?

# ## How is the dataset indexed?
# 
# Print the DataFrame index and describe it.

# ## Summarize the DataFrame.
# 
# Use a single function (method) to describe the data (to show the mean, standard deviation, various quintiles, etc). This method should only work on one of the columns by default, but can be called on the whole dataset (a method of the DataFrame).

# %%


# %% [markdown]
# ## Summarize all the columns
# 
# Run `users.describe(include = "all")` and see how it compares to what we did before.

# %%


# %% [markdown]
# ## Run `describe` only on the `occupation` column

# %%


# %% [markdown]
# ## What is the mean age of users?

# %%
