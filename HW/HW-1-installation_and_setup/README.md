# HW 1

However, the first class will use [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), a free online Python notebook platform that doesn't require any installation. However, each lecture after this will use the following software. Please make sure to install these before then. If you need help installing this software, please  ask for help in the discussion section on Canvas.

 - Python 3.9, Anaconda Distribution
   - For this class, please download the [Anaconda distribution of Python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). Be sure to download Python, version 3.9. 
   When you install Anaconda, be sure to install the full Anaconda distribution. 
   The MiniConda version is nice, but I only recommend it for advanced users. Nice instructions for instlaling and using Anaconda can be found (here.)[https://datascience.quantecon.org/introduction/local_install.html]
 - The Visual Studio Code text editor
   - A good text editor is important for software development. Some of your classes will use a fully-fledged Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm. For this review, I suggest Visual Studio Code. You can download it here: https://code.visualstudio.com/
   - I recommend installing the Anaconda Extension Pack, [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter), and [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) VS Code extensions.
 - Git (optional, but recommended)
   - Although there are many different Git clients and Git GUI's that you could use,
   I prefer that you install GitKraken. GitKraken bundles a Git Client with its GUI, so you don't need to install multiple pieces of software. [GitKraken can be downloaded here.](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
   - Some classes will use GitHub. GitHub is a website that allows you to store, interactic with, and share your Git repositories online. [Please register an account with GitHub](https://github.com/) if you don't already have one.
