# 3. Agenda

- **Questions about HW2?**
- **Overview of Pandas** As aspiring quantitative finance professionals, Pandas is likely the most important Python package you will use. It is a powerful data manipulation library that is built on top of Numpy. It is especially useful for working with time series data. We will go over the basics of Pandas and then work through a series of exercises to practice using Pandas. I'll skim through some introductory material from [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) by Jake VanderPlas.
  - [Introducing Pandas Objects](./_notebook_build/_02_01-Introducing-Pandas-Objects.ipynb)
- Today we will use notebooks within VS Code. We'll also begin the discussion of writing `.py` files directly. The week after that we will move away from notebooks entirely. 
- Discuss the features of using the Python and Jupyter extensions within VS Code.
  - Overview: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/overview
  - Variable explorer and data viewer: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks#_variable-explorer-and-data-viewer
  - Custom notebook diffing: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks#_custom-notebook-diffing
- Demonstration of Git and GitHub
  - VS Code especially makes Git diffs of Jupyter notebooks easy. Demonstrate why they are otherwise difficult.
- Finish discussion of Pandas from previous lecture:
  - Set of in-class exercises: [./src/occupations.ipynb](./_01_occupations.ipynb)
  - `03.03-Operations-in-Pandas.ipynb`
  - `03.04-Missing-Values.ipynb`
- Demonstrate Pandas in the context of factor analysis/principal components analysis of a panel (Note from 2023. Ran out of time at the beginning of discussing this notebook.)
of economic and financial time series. [./src/factor_analysis_demo.ipynb](./_notebook_build/_03_factor_analysis_demo.ipynb)
- Very quick review of Numpy, Matplotlib, and Scipy, with emphasis on plotting


- Start with discussion of Pandas. Start going over the Pandas chapter from
    ["Python Data Science
    Handbook"](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook)
    - `02_00-Introduction-to-Pandas.ipynb`
    - `02_01-Introducing-Pandas-Objects.ipynb`
    - `02_02-Data-Indexing-and-Selection.ipynb`
    - Break for an set of in-class exercises:
      [./src/01_occupations.ipynb](./_notebook_build/_01_occupations.ipynb)
    - `02_03-Operations-in-Pandas.ipynb`
    - `02_04-Missing-Values.ipynb`
- Homework for next time: See HW 2 folder. These are a series of short exercises
    to practice using Pandas.
