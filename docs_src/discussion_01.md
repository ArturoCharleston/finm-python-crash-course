- Introduction: Who am I? What's the goal of this review?
- **Course Page on GitHub**

    - Course textbook: https://jeremybejarano.com/finm-python-crash-course/
- [**Set up Environment**](./01_setting_up_environment.md): Today we will make sure that everyone has their computational environment set
up correctly. This includes Python (via the Anaconda distribution), Visual
Studio Code, Git and GitHub, and a WRDS class count for this course.
- [**Various Method of Interacting with Python**](./01_methods_for_using_python.md): Throughout the course, we'll
discuss the various ways of interacting with Python: Google Collab, Jupyter
Notebooks through the standard Jupyter server, Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code,
using IPython in the command line, and running Python scripts directly from the
command line (`.py` files).
- [**Overview of the PyData Stack**](./_notebook_build/_01_overview_of_pydata_stack.ipynb): We'll go over the
various libraries that we'll be using in this course. This includes NumPy,
SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- [**Python by Example**](./_notebook_build/_01_python_by_example.ipynb): We'll go through some examples of Python basics: basic control-flow, functions, and classes.
- [**Homework 1**](./_notebook_build/_HW1-numpy-scipy.ipynb): We'll start working on Homework 1. This homework will be due before the next class. It will not be graded, but it will be a good way to get started with the material.
