FINM August Python Introduction and Review: Week 1
==================================================

Agenda

  - Introduction: Who am I? What's the goal of this review?
  - Review course page on GitHub: https://github.com/jmbejara/finm-python-crash-course
  - Today we will use Jupyter Notebooks on Google's Colab platform. Next week we will use Jupyter Notebooks locally to do all of our coding. In week 3 we will use notebooks within VS Code. In week 4 we will move away from notebooks and write `.py` files directly.
  - But, first, let me give you a sneak peak of VS Code, standard Jupyter notebook, JupyterLab, Spyder, IPython in the command line, and running a `.py` file from the command line. (Nothing deep. Just showing that these options exist.)
  - Discuss assignment for next week (installing software). (Assignments are not graded. This is an optional review.)
      - List of software to install is on the main README: https://github.com/jmbejara/finm-python-crash-course/blob/main/README.md
      - Helpful text to understand the process of setting up your environment: https://datascience.quantecon.org/introduction/local_install.html
  - [Run Python Demo Notebook in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jmbejara/finm-python-crash-course/blob/main/week_1/Part_1_Python_Jupyter_demo.ipynb)
  - Start HW1 as a group. Discuss how the Jupyter notebook can be used for HW. Formatting is important! [Work through problems together here.](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jmbejara/finm-python-crash-course/blob/main/HW/HW-1-numpy-scipy/HW1.ipynb)
  - With the remaining time, we'll take a step back and go over some of the more basic aspects of Python. We'll go through some simpler examples in the following notebooks (which can be accessed in Google Colab).
